    <h1>A quick summary of last week</h1>
    <p>
        In this little document I'll summarize what I have learned during this last week. 
        The topics touched were how does the internet work, and the history of html. Also, 
        about how to work with HTML in a basic level, such as this document!
    </p>
    <p>
        I suppose version control with GitHub is also a topic, but I haven studied it yet. I do 
        have the idea since I've already been working with GitHub for a while, but a quick study 
        wouldn't hurt.
    </p>
    <h2>How does the internet work?</h2>
    <p>
        To begin with, there is a bunch of stuff I needed to understand, at least in a intuitive 
        level. Things such as:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Client:</b> Are the computers that want to enter on a website. These send a request
                to the servers via the internet, following the TCP/IP protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Server:</b> These computers store the data, the website, and receive the requests from
                the clients to access the website/data. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>TCP/IP:</b> These are a bunch of <em>protocols</em> that direct how to communicate
                between the computers in the web.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>HTTP:</b> This protocol helps out the render of a website. Since websites are built with
                HTML, which is an language for writing with hypertext, these two things work together. Is with 
                this protocol that requests are send and (probably) the server's response to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>DNS:</b> Kinda of topic, but still very useful for people like me, who forgets complex things.
                The servers and clients use an IP address, part of the Internet Protocol, so that the data knows
                where to travel. But IP address are hard to memorize, since is all just numbers. So, we use domains
                and names to refer to those IP address, which are easier to memorize.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        With this knowledge, I'll try to explain how does the internet work. I learned it today tho, so
        don't quote me on that.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the client enters the URL of the website it wants to visit in the internet browser. 
        Then, the browser checks in the DNS that the domain does refert to an IP address. If it does,
        it gets the information needed to send a request to the server of the domain searched. Such 
        request is "written" with HTTP, and is sent through the internet following the TCP/IP.
    </p>
    <p>
        The request is received by the website's server, which is basically asking for a copy of the 
        website so that it can show in the browser of the client. If the server agrees to do so, it will
        send a response to the browser, kind of a confirmation that it will send a copy to the client's
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For sending the copy, it is divided into really tiny bits of information that will be sent to the
        the browser, each of them looking for the fastest way to do so. Those bits or data are called data
        packages, and is a strategy for allowing multiple users to download the website without clogging all
        the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The browser starts to receive the packages, and is its job to rebuild the website with those packages.
        After receiven all the data packages, the website is displayed in the browser and the client can watch
        whatever the heck it was looking for. All of these done in about one second. Truly a marvel of engineering
        and technology just to display furry porn in the client's PC.
